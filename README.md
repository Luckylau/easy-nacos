## What does it do

Nacos (official site: [http://nacos.io](http://nacos.io)) is an easy-to-use platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. It helps you to build cloud native applications and microservices platform easily.

Service is a first-class citizen in Nacos. Nacos supports almost all type of services，for example，[Dubbo/gRPC service](https://nacos.io/en-us/docs/use-nacos-with-dubbo.html)、[Spring Cloud RESTFul service](https://nacos.io/en-us/docs/use-nacos-with-springcloud.html) or [Kubernetes service](https://nacos.io/en-us/docs/use-nacos-with-kubernetes.html).

Nacos provides four major functions.

* **Service Discovery and Service Health Check** 
  
    Nacos makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. Nacos also provides real-time healthchecks of services to prevent sending requests to unhealthy hosts or service instance.

* **Dynamic Configuration Management**
  
  Dynamic Configuration Service allows you to manage configurations of all services in a centralized and dynamic manner across all environments. Nacos eliminates the need to redeploy applications and services when configurations are updated，which makes configuration changes more efficient and agile.

* **Dynamic DNS Service**

   Nacos supports weighted routing, making it easier for you to implement mid-tier load balancing, flexible routing policies, flow control, and simple DNS resolution services in the production environment within your data center. It helps you to implement DNS-based service discovery easily and prevent applications from coupling to vendor-specific service discovery APIs.

* **Service and MetaData Management**
	
	Nacos provides an easy-to-use service dashboard to help you manage your services metadata, configuration, kubernetes DNS, service health and metrics statistics.
